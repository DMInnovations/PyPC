2. Click on the newest version of "PyPC-Tests"
3. Click on "Assets", and then click on the source code file, to your liking

___OR___

## Simple Tests
- This category of tests adds basic math problems and simple "for" loops
- Math tests options:
    - Adding
    - Subtracing
    - Multiplying
    - Dividing

## Sorting Tests
- This category of tests adds two different types of sorting algorithms/tests; selection, merge, greatest to least and least to greatest, and bubble sort.

## General Computer Information
- This is Python file allows you to get your computer's CPU and OS information
    - CPU Count
    - Processor Type
    - Architecture
    - OS Name
    - RAM Usage
    - CPU Usage
    - CPU Physical & Logical Cores
    - Swap Memory
    - CPU Temperature
      
## Algorthmic
- This adds more complex tasks/algorithms
    - Wave Function
    - Prime Counter 

## Multiprocessing
- This uses current tests in PyPC and uses multiprocessing to max out your CPU to test how fast your computer can process a task under heavy load
    - Merge Sorting
    - Prime Counting
 
## WiFi Speed Test
- This adds a WiFi download and upload speed test

## How To Use
- Load up the `scoreSys.py` file in your project
- Call the function, `.allTests(letter list, int a, int b, number list)`

__OR__

- Use `python ScoringSys.py` to run PyPC in the terminal
